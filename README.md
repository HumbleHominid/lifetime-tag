## Tag Log

### Jordan -> Lasag June 16th, Berkeley CA
It's been 6 years since the burden has been handed over to someone else in the group. Mostly because Jordan never remembered he was it.
On this fateful day while eating Mac and Cheese with Lisa and Lasag, Jordan remembered he was it, and devised a quick plan.

He would use Lisa to distract Lasag while walking off the 4 lbs of mac and cheese that had been eaten, and film himself tagging lasag in place
many hold sacred. The brown eye.

Footage of this event was captured and sent to the groupchat.

### Jared -> Jordan Some time in 2017, Santa Rosa CA

### Jordan -> Jared Some time in 2013, Berkeley CA

Whilst visiting Jared at his freshman dorm, Jordan asked Jared to show him a new update of Project M. 
While Jared was setting up the game, Jordan Photographed him from behind and sent the image to the Group chat. 
It was at that moment his fate was sealed.
